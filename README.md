## Fundamentals of Programming I (Course Syllabus)

### Course Description

Computer programming involves various activities such as understanding and analysis of problems, algorithm design, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and coding of algorithms. This course is designed to allow students to acquire the three basic skills of programming: problem solving skill (understand how they solve problems), algorithmic skill (knowing how to write the steps of their proposed solutions to specific problems), language skill (learning how to put the solutions in to code and communicate it to the machine).

More specifically as an introduction, this course designed to introduce students to an overview of the different concepts of programming and problem-solving strategies.  Moreover, the learners will be able to identify and demonstrate the basic programming constructors like Variables, Reserved words, Syntax diagram, Constant declarations, Data types, and also the concepts of various programming techniques such as, Conditional statements, Loops, array, strings, pointers (static and dynamic memory management), Error types and error debugging techniques. For each topic, some coding guidelines will be discussed.  

### Course Learning Outcome (CLO): 
At the end of the course the student will be able to do:
* CLO1	Identify the basic concepts of programming and program development process 
* CLO2	Demonstrate problem solving skills by analyzing a variety of real-world problems using program solving techniques (flow chart and pseudo code).
* CLO3	Identify and apply the basic programming constructors’ and the various programming techniques such as control statements, loops, arrays and pointers in solving problems.
* CLO4	Develop, debug and test small scale applications
