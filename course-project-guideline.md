**Course Title and Code: Internet Programming I (SWEG3107)**

**1) Objectives** 

The course project work aims to allow and enable students to:

1.1) Design websites or web-app by defining the structure of web documents.

1.2) Construct web-based solutions (web-based applications) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1.3) De(cribe and follow the principles, standards, and best practices of web design and development.

1.4) Use modern design and development tools and techniques like Git and Git-Hub, WAVE, Dev-tools, Figma, etc.

**2) Mapping Objective with the CLO**

**3) General Instructions and Project Requirements** 
- The team should use modern collaborative tools for design, development, and documentation. 
  - Git hub and Git --- for development collaboration and version controlling
  - Google Doc and slides or MS Office 365 – for documentation and presentation slide
- The team should use real data and web content for the proposed project title.
- The implementation should satisfy the principle of writability/readability and web accessibility. In another word, you should follow the principles and best practices of web design and development and the technologies you are using (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). 
- Both your documentation and presentation should be well organized and formatted (font, color, font family, spacing, size, etc.).
- Properly follow and submit your work before or on due dates. 
- All submissions should be through G. Classroom and/or University eLearning by the team leader only.
- In your submission, you should provide only the link to the project repository (Git hub repository link) and the report document (Google doc/slide or MS Office with at least comment permission).
